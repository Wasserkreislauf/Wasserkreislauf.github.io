Many topics addressed in science education concern aspects of the world that cannot be directly observed, such as structures and processes of the microcosm (e.g., molecules, atoms) or the macrocosm (e.g., the solar system). However, actively experiencing and manipulating a dynamic environment is a crucial source of learning, especially for children. There is therefore a need for innovative teaching methods that facilitate access to processes and structures that cannot be directly observed. In this context, virtual reality (VR) offers an interesting potential for science teaching, as it allows interaction with virtual model worlds and immersion in virtual model worlds. Both interactive and immersive characteristics are important sources of learning from an educational and developmental point of view.

In this project, a virtual environment on the water cycle, including the particle model, will be developed and evaluated in cooperation with teachers. This environment will complement existing textbooks/materials and can be used in primary school (11-12 years).

**Criteria for topic selection were:**
* topic concerning a non-directly observable environment (microcosm or macrocosm) 
* topic centrally based on the school program (Lehrplan 21) 
* topic easily implemented in a VR environment 
* topic of high societal relevance. 


In this research project we will compare different educational media and hypothesize that interactive and immersive aspects of VR compared to other media (e.g., book, video, game application) will facilitate the understanding of inaccessible micro- and macrocosmic structures.
